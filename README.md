# BaaS Framework

## Overview

The **BaaS Framework** is an open-source Backend as a Service (BaaS) framework designed to provide backend functionality for a variety of backend frameworks across multiple languages, including but not limited to:

- Go
- TypeScript
- Rust
- PHP
- Deno
- Node.js
- and more!

### Core Features:
- **Default BaaS**: Supports optional cloud functions for common tasks.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Fine-grained role, table, and namespace-level permissions.
- **Database Integration**: Compatibility with modern real-time databases like RethinkDB, SurrealDB, etc.
- **Object Storage**: Built-in support for object storage solutions.
- **Extendability**: Easy to add custom routes and extend functionality beyond the BaaS features.

### Why This Framework?

Our mission is to simplify backend development by providing a highly flexible, language-agnostic BaaS framework that developers can plug into their existing server setup. Whether you're using Go, Node, PHP, or other frameworks, this BaaS will offer you a unified and scalable solution to handle authentication, database operations, storage, and more.
